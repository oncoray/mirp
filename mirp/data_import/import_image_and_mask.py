    """
    Creates and curates references to image and mask files. This function is usually called internally by other
    functions such as :func:`~mirp.extractFeaturesAndImages.extract_features`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image: Any
        A path to an image file, a path to a directory containing image files, a path to a config_data.xml
        file, a path to a csv file containing references to image files, a pandas.DataFrame containing references to
        image files, or a numpy.ndarray.

    mask: Any
        A path to a mask file, a path to a directory containing mask files, a path to a config_data.xml
        file, a path to a csv file containing references to mask files, a pandas.DataFrame containing references to
        mask files, or a numpy.ndarray.

    sample_name: str or list of str, default: None
        Name of expected sample names. This is used to select specific image files. If None, no image files are
        filtered based on the corresponding sample name (if known).

    image_name: str, optional, default: None
        Pattern to match image files against. The matches are exact. Use wildcard symbols ("*") to
        match varying structures. The sample name (if part of the file name) can also be specified using "#". For
        example, image_name = '#_*_image' would find John_Doe in John_Doe_CT_image.nii or John_Doe_001_image.nii.
        File extensions do not need to be specified. If None, file names are not used for filtering files and
        setting sample names.

    image_file_type: {"dicom", "nifti", "nrrd", "numpy", "itk"}, optional, default: None
        The type of file that is expected. If None, the file type is not used for filtering files.
        "itk" comprises "nifti" and "nrrd" file types.

    image_modality: {"ct", "pet", "pt", "mri", "mr", "rtdose", "generic"}, optional, default: None
        The type of modality that is expected. If None, modality is not used for filtering files. Note that only
        DICOM files contain metadata concerning modality.

    image_sub_folder: str, optional, default: None
        Fixed directory substructure where image files are located. If None, the directory substructure is not used
        for filtering files.

    mask_name: str or list of str, optional, default: None
        Pattern to match mask files against. The matches are exact. Use wildcard symbols ("*") to match varying
        structures. The sample name (if part of the file name) can also be specified using "#". For example,
        mask_name = '#_*_mask' would find John_Doe in John_Doe_CT_mask.nii or John_Doe_001_mask.nii. File extensions
        do not need to be specified. If None, file names are not used for filtering files and setting sample names.

    mask_file_type: {"dicom", "nifti", "nrrd", "numpy", "itk"}, optional, default: None
        The type of file that is expected. If None, the file type is not used for filtering files.
        "itk" comprises "nifti" and "nrrd" file types.

    mask_modality: {"rtstruct", "seg", "generic_mask"}, optional, default: None
        The type of modality that is expected. If None, modality is not used for filtering files.
        Note that only DICOM files contain metadata concerning modality. Masks from non-DICOM files are considered to
        be "generic_mask".

    mask_sub_folder: str, optional, default: None
        Fixed directory substructure where mask files are located. If None, the directory substructure is not used for
        filtering files.

    roi_name: str or list of str or dict, optional, default: None
        Name of the regions of interest that should be assessed.

    association_strategy: {"frame_of_reference", "sample_name", "file_distance", "file_name_similarity",  "list_order", "position", "single_image"}
        The preferred strategy for associating images and masks. File association is preferably done using frame of
        reference UIDs (DICOM), or sample name (NIfTI, numpy). Other options are relatively frail, except for
        `list_order` which may be applicable when a list with images and a list with masks is provided and both lists
        are of equal length.

    stack_images: {"auto", "yes", "no"}, optional, default: "str"
        If image files in the same directory cannot be assigned to different samples, and are 2D (slices) of the same
        size, they might belong to the same 3D image stack. "auto" will stack 2D numpy arrays, but not other file types.
        "yes" will stack all files that contain 2D images, that have the same dimensions, orientation and spacing,
        except for DICOM files. "no" will not stack any files. DICOM files ignore this argument, because their stacking
        can be determined from metadata.

    stack_masks: {"auto", "yes", "no"}, optional, default: "str"
        If mask files in the same directory cannot be assigned to different samples, and are 2D (slices) of the same
        size, they might belong to the same 3D mask stack. "auto" will stack 2D numpy arrays, but not other file
        types. "yes" will stack all files that contain 2D images, that have the same dimensions, orientation and
        spacing, except for DICOM files. "no" will not stack any files. DICOM files ignore this argument,
        because their stacking can be determined from metadata.

    Returns
    -------
    list[ImageFile]
        The functions returns a list of ImageFile objects, if any were found with the specified filters.
